# CampusCleared
A POC script to automatically complete the CampusClear COVID-19 symptom screener each day.

This script was written in the Fall of 2020. It was inspired by my growing ambition to automate daily tasks and the fear that I would inevitably forget to complete my screener.

Disclaimer: This should not be used in place of screening yourself each day using the app. I have only decided to publish it because the app no longer allows for new installations and many schools have long abandoned the daily screening requirement. I have also removed all relevant POST data leaving only the endpoint.
